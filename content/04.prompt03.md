## Prompt 3: How can editors and writers work together to ensure more representative reporting?
Moderator: Sarah Zielinski (\@SarahZielinski)

(From Sarah, moderator) At *[Science News for Students](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/)*, we do several things in this venue. For years we have had a requirement that features include as a source at least one woman or person of color. Our audience is young, and we have felt that it is particularly important that they see that science has a place for everyone. In 2018, we began tracking the diversity of our sources in an ad hoc manner. We use that data in house only to track our progress. This year, we asked that our writers help contribute to our diversity tracking effort, and some of them now provide that information (via a Google form) for the stories they report. To help my writers in their efforts, I provided a document with suggestions about how to find more diverse sources. It also gave a script that writers could use when speaking with sources so that they could collect demographic data as part of their reporting. (Other than the requirement for features, the rest is voluntary.)

**Finding sources outside the US**

In the case of stories that take place in countries outside the United States, always include the testimonies of local researchers. Not just from the US.

There is also a Mexican association of science writers and journalists (Red Mexicana de Periodistas de Ciencia). This group may help you connect with sources at least in Mexico. [https://redmpc.wordpress.com/](https://redmpc.wordpress.com/)

This is the Argentinian network of science journalism. [https://radpc.org/](https://radpc.org/)

If you’re doing reporting in another country, contact a local science writer. They are often willing to help you figure out the lay of the land.

**Other suggestions from the group:**

It’s important to start a network early of people that you can reach out to. When you’re working under pressure, it’s hard to do this on the fly.

Editors could check in with who the sources are. They can’t just rely on the writer. 

Editors should seriously consider whether a deadline is hard or not. If writers know that an editor might be able move a deadline, it makes it easier to make finding diverse sources a priority.

When writing about a paper, look down the list of authors. There are often younger and more diverse people farther down the list. Also ask the first author for people who can comment.

Instead of starting with your story and then searching for diverse sources, you can start with the sources and then find the story. This is especially important when dealing with an overwhelmingly white area (whether geographically or scientifically).

[Eos](https://eos.org/) did diversity tracking for a year and has now switched to sending those sources a survey to ask them directly. The advantages of this include that data collection is more accurate and you can also ask things like if a source is early career, LGBTQIA, etc. Here is the survey (we have taken out the early career question at the moment, because the definition is fuzzy… welcome any thoughts on that): [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelvtFUtB9IEaKz6LiJx_pFKnHrxZvOPRl4g4oDi8DxirS__g/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSelvtFUtB9IEaKz6LiJx_pFKnHrxZvOPRl4g4oDi8DxirS__g/viewform)

It’s important for an editor to have that five-minute discussion in the beginning, at story assignment, about expectations, which should include sources and voices that a reporter includes in the story. “We all need a reminder.”

500 women scientists ([website](https://500womenscientists.org/)) has always been a good source for me.

Twitter sometimes has Black in ____ weeks -- I try to follow and make a spreadsheet of new scholars and their expertise/contact for future stories.

There are also some smaller groups like “[Ladies of Landsat](https://twitter.com/LadiesOfLandsat)” that can be good sources.
