## Prompt 7: How can science writers better cover social justice issues?

PIO from JHU says that even when she publishes stories about health inequities, or POC communities, she finds that journalists don’t like to cover these stories. She keeps pushing it because it’s important, but gets severely less pick-up. 

Others chimed in that it’s possible writers don’t know how to tackle these stories with clarity / nuance, and they risk saying something insensitive or off-base during the interview. Someone said that these stories seem touchier -- “how can I convey this information without being offensive, or should I just not cover it at all?” 

Several attendees commented on the idea of "sensitivity readers":  
* "I think one big step is knowing what you don’t know, and when you need to hire a sensitivity reader (or possibly revise your institution’s style guide)."  
* "I think of a sensitivity reader as someone who knows all the latest style guide updates and can turn a careful and thoughtful eye to your copy and see places that might be problematic."  
* "I’d argue that you need to have multiple sensitivity readers available. For instance, I wouldn’t necessarily expect a Black sensitivity reader to be the authority on LGBTQ+ issues and language."  
* "I’ve had sub-editors change “disabled scientist” to “scientist with disabilities” when the former was direct from the scientist I interviewed"  

When covering people affected by social justice issues: It’s challenging to get people to find people to speak on the record without being triggered. 

Sometimes folks want to stay anonymous, but anonymous sources may impact credibility of a piece.

It may be helpful to look at these issues from a sociological point of view: why is this [injustice] happening? Why are people behaving this way -- to put events in context. 

Freelancers writing about social justice issues are not always confident that their editors are trained to recognize the sensitivity that social justice stories may need during editing. 

TL,DR: Would be helpful to have resources on NASW, for instance, that provides guidance on how to cover social justice issues as a writer, and how to navigate editing social justice stories as an editor.
