## Prompt 2: What aspects of diversity are science writers neglecting?
Moderator: Doris Truong ([\@DorisTruong](https://twitter.com/DorisTruong))

**Takeaways**:  

* Ask sources whether they’re open to sharing demographic information.  
* Make sure tracking diversity of sources is embedded in your business practices. Here’s a [sample form from America Amplified](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1h0b6t5FK2xUv6YZZxesFF2ikOP65IhwwHU3ZVQccMfI/edit).  
* Push people to direct you to more diverse sources. Don’t let them stop with the usual suspect(s).  
* Look carefully at study design and interpretation of disparate results.

Body diversity is a subject that’s lacking in coverage - anything from disability to different body shapes. We focus on including all races, but representation from all races are still predominantly physically fit individuals.

Often feel like we’re not doing enough to accommodate for physical disability, especially alt-text and hashtags on social media-- so even after stories are told, aren’t always accessible

Recently told that I tweeted too much about my mental health issues and it might affect my hireability…  

* ^definitely a generational difference (e.g., students are more willing to discuss this)

Often discussion about tracking diversity of sources quickly defaults to tracking only binary gender. I think that’s a significant limitation that we should work to move beyond.  

* ^^once interviewed a nonbinary person, found out and used their preferred name when talking to them and writing the draft, but failed to ask if that’s what they wanted to appear in print so I ended up having to change it in the piece to the (different) name that they publish under  
An earlier session talked about the importance of exploring how diversity intersects with the foundations of many scientific fields. How science is done, what questions are asked and how.  
* ^Absolutely. Too often study subjects are all one sex, or not diverse in other ways.

— When writing about studies, look carefully at how the researchers interpreted results that varied by racial/ethnic/sex/age/etc groups: how do they attribute/allocate differences in results to genetic vs. environmental factors? What questions did they ask along these lines (e.g., urban vs. rural residences, SES status)  

— Thinking about identity variables as representing something else (access to healthcare, experience of discrimination, cultural practices, ex). We need to fine tune our analyses so that we understand what outcomes related to identity are being invoked when we say disparities exist.  

* ^^I think this is super important. If we’re not talking about the social determinants of health in reporting on health disparities then I really fear that we’re straying into the language of genetic determinism.  
* ^^^When one observes disparities, the next step is to learn what factors might be behind that. Some are very subtle. Chandra Jackson, Ph.D. (NIEHS) looks at sleep disparities. For example, the homes of lower-income folks tend to be in noisier neighborhoods, with more disturbed sleep as a result. And guess what, cardiovascular health and so much else is related to sleep. So, not income/education/race per se, but the noise and light levels where you sleep.  
* ^^ooh that’s super interesting! Makes me think of people with little kids --like how the pandemic has especially negatively affected women because of the burden of care and invisible work?

As a woman of color, often writing about or communicating perspectives on “hot topic” issues can lead to being perceived as the “angry black/brown woman”. Difficulty towing the line between being passionate about a subject and coming off as “angry”.  

* ^^ also a WOC, and I do feel pressure to conform to acceptable norms, which may limit my ability to tell the story / add my personal experience  
* +1 Yes, and it often feels like you need to write about these topics for a White audience and explain yourself…  
* ^^Exactly! Are there any/enough pieces written by BIPOC for BIPOC?

Global diversity. Also making sure that we don’t assume a single person represents an entire group. There is diversity within “diversity”  
Re global diversity: reporters sometimes give different amounts of identifying information for researchers from different countries which transmits the idea that for some countries it’s notable that researchers are from there and for some countries it’s not, and that conveys bias.  

* Scientists often move around the globe. For global diversity, do you consider their location or nationality? (Sometimes you don’t even know their nationality!)

I’ve been working on developing a source-tracking document for use at The Open Notebook (to also share with reporters and newsrooms who may wish to adapt it for their use), and one of the challenges in doing that has turned out to be figuring out which dimensions of diversity to attempt to track, i.e., finding a balance between too simplistic and too unworkably complex.  

* ^I would download a source-tracking Google Spreadsheet in a heartbeat

My thought is that it’s more difficult to address diversity that isn’t immediately visible or even known to you as a writer.  
In The Open Notebook’s “[Finding Diverse Sources for Science Stories](https://www.theopennotebook.com/finding-diverse-sources-for-science-stories/)” document, we recommend that reporters consider sending a note to sources that says something like: “Our publication is committed to including diverse sources in our stories so that we can accurately capture the range of experts whose voices, perspectives, and expertise are relevant. Toward that end, we try to track information about who our sources are. If you are comfortable doing so, I would appreciate it if you would let me know whether you identify as a member of any historically marginalized communities. This information will be used for internal accountability purposes, and no individual information will be shared publicly. Again, this is voluntary, but would be helpful to us as we work toward greater equity and inclusion in our coverage.”

In the opening plenary, someone made the point that it’s necessary for journalists/science writers to become more comfortable with being uncomfortable. I feel that’s 100% correct. (I’m thinking of this particularly with respect to asking sources about their identities as part of a source-tracking effort)

Do societal norms prevent us from sharing our own lived experiences that would expand the list of diversity axes? As someone with unexplained infertility who conceived through in vitro fertilization, will conception status and fertility status be folded in under family status or reach more prominence as more people are conceived through interventions?

Re: imposter syndrome: Do not assume WHY the woman referred you to her male colleague: maybe there’s a pecking order in her department and she’d face retaliation if she didn’t toss the request to the alpha male.  
Important point. Also, I wonder if we can be more forthright when a PIO tries to steer us toward a less diverse source.  

* ^ as a PIO: respectfully ask “why the diversion” is a good place to start.

Re: immigration status, I used to write a lot about student experiences and international students were definitely less willing to speak to me about anything they perceived as a contentious issues (e.g., their university’s COVID response) which was very sad :( for them and also b/c it made the story less diverse…

Has anyone found a great resource for images of members of underrepresented groups? That is so important but can also be very time intensive.  
being very careful about not tokenizing people by using images out of the context in which they were intended.
