## Prompt 1: When does it make sense to specifically include diversity and representation angles of sources and subjects in stories?

Non-profit’s [www.SciCommDiversity.org](http://www.SciCommDiversity.org) Fellowship connects diversity journalism organizations members (Natl Assoc of Black Journo, NAHispanicJ, NativeAJA) to NASW community. 

Overview of fellowship program published: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2020.00051/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcomm.2020.00051/full). Article has examples of how to include diversity angle to science reporting (for _DiverseScholar.org_ magazine [see [https://communitypartners.org/project/diverse-scholar](https://communitypartners.org/project/diverse-scholar)]).
Thx to NASW Idea Grant funding for catalyzing fellowship.

FYI, if searching for diversity STEM communities, pls see Alberto’s non-profit's Stakeholders page w/ many non-profits (eg NOBCChE Black Chemists, SACNAS Latinx & Native Americans), events (eg Tapia Computing, ABRCMS Biomedical Minority) and now new online communities ([#LatinxChem](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LatinXChem), [#BlackAndSTEM](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackandSTEM), [\@500QueerSci](https://twitter.com/500queersci)) [https://www.minoritypostdoc.org/stakeholders](https://www.minoritypostdoc.org/stakeholders) 

If the person decides to go that route (of talking about their background), continue the conversation, even if you didn’t plan on covering that specifically through that angle. Ask questions that continue to move in that direction.

When presented with choices of sources and angles, actively choose inclusivity.

As an ally reporting on a minority source/story, it will be difficult to please every possible reader.  

* Depend on allies to tell the story if/when the reporter isn’t a member of the community.  
* Do try to find an ambassador/liaison to the community you’re reporting on to build trust.  

**Question**: how to approach identity when it’s not the main subject of the story?

Ask sources how they would like to be identified, give them the space to share or to not share.
If they just want to talk about science, then perhaps it might be pertinent to ask why their identity is not a part of their science or research.

I’m thinking of the [Henrietta Lacks book](http://rebeccaskloot.com/the-immortal-life/) where, IMO, the author seemed to do a good job at putting herself in a position of vulnerability and trying to be an ally, share the story of someone else and their family.

In a non-direct way, perhaps describe to source about how your news outlet has a diversity mission/initiative. Note: this tactic is more common during job interviews, where hiring manager & candidate are assessing culture of organization.

Research your source’s professional organization membership and/or service activities. If any have a diversity mission, then ask about that community/work.

**Leading questions**: How did you get interested in this research or field?

**At the end of interview**: Is there anything you wished I’d ask you? Anything I might not have known to ask you?

I’ve found the [Inclusive SciComm](https://inclusivescicomm.org/) community to be a great place to learn about how to respectfully include DEI (or JEDI :) ) in your writing work
