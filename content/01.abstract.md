As a follow-up to the opening plenary session ([Whova link](https://whova.com/portal/webapp/scien2_202010/Agenda/1144504)) organized by Shraddha Chakradhar and Jenny Cutraro at [ScienceWriters2020](https://sciencewriters2020.org), we invited attendees to brainstorm ideas for improving diversity in science reporting. Participants were randomly split into seven breakout rooms, each discussing one prompt. We asked them to populate Google documents with their best ideas, strategies and resources, which we have now compiled into a single resource for the science writing community.
