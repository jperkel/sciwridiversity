## Prompt 4: What tools, resources, and strategies can you use to gauge and improve representation in your writing and reporting?

We have to devote time to diversity

Monitor your diversity statistics. Then review them regularly. Every month? Every quarter? Every six months?

The Native American Journalists Association is a good source for media reporting guides about American Indian communities and culture. [https://najanewsroom.com/](https://najanewsroom.com/) 

* What are the stories you’re covering? That impacts the people interviewed.

* Seek out more voices from multiple disciplines.

* Who are the post-docs or research assistants? Try doing a group interview to avoid the PI dominating the narratives.

* It also helps to have questions prepared beforehand that involve every person in the team (provided that there is some prior knowledge about the roles of everyone)

* Journalists tend to interview the same folks … and these practices tend to impede diversity.

* We look for experts at smaller institutions, too.

* For press officers who can, sometimes you can track down a reserved grad student/postdoc in-person after the group interview with a few follow-up questions.

* Do the universities have diverse people? It’s not all on the PIOs. What is our role in diversity Initiatives?

* Identify diverse sources but also sources (who may be white men) who care about representation who will help you find others
    * Ask experts for other sources, perhaps even for diversity.

* Also look toward specialized journals for experts because the main journals often marginalize work in diversity -- [https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/68/2/254/4958972](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/68/2/254/4958972) 

* Know there is visible and invisible diversity
    * Visible: Race, sex  
    * Invisible: SES, region, sexual orientation  

* We need to think about diversity tracking in an holistic way

* Work on making experts comfortable

* Promote the work of various colleagues -- embrace this ethic in diversity training

* **Question**: has anyone found a great resource for images of members of underrepresented groups? That is so important but can also be very time intensive. We currently use Shutterstock.

    * There’s a new resource of free images of Black professionals. Just a sec.
